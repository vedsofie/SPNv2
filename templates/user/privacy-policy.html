    <ul><u><b>Our Privacy Commitment</b></u></ul>

    <p>
        Sofie Biosciences, Inc. (“<b>Sofie,</b>” “<b>we,</b>” “<b>us</b>” or “<b>our</b>”) is committed to respecting the privacy rights and concerns of all users of the Sofie Probe Network (including, without limitation, the services and software made available through the Sofie Probe Network (collectively, as the “Network”). As such, we have established and implemented this Privacy Policy to inform users of the Network how we use and protect the information we collect through the Network. By using the Network, you consent to Sofie’s collection, use, storage, deletion and disclosure of information relating to you as set forth in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date set forth above and is only applicable to the Network and not to any other website that you may be able to access through the Network which may have its own data collection and use practices and policies.
    </p>


    This policy answers the following questions:
    <ol>
        <ul>
            <li>What information do we collect about you and how do we use it?</li>
            <li>Will we share your personal information with third parties?</li>
            <li>What choices do you have about the collection and use of your personal information?</li>
            <li>What security measures do we take to safeguard your personal information?</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <ul><u><b>What information do we collect about you and how do we use it?</b></u></ul>

    <ul><b>Types of Information We Collect</b></ul>


    <p>Personal information means information that can be used to identify and contact you. You do not need to submit personal information to access the Network generally. However, you may be required to submit personal information to access certain aspects of the Network. We may collect non-personal information, such as your browser type, when you access the Network and the physical location where you access the Network. This information may be aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent, page views, and other statistics about users of the Network. We also may use this data to monitor the Network’ performance and to make the Network easier and more convenient to use.</p>

    <p>We collect personal information when you create an account through the Network or participate in feedback forms or order forms.</p>

    <p>To create an account for the Network, we require you to provide certain information to create your profile, including your name, email address, user name, telephone number and password. Providing additional information beyond what is required to create an account, including a profile picture, is optional.</p>

    <p>By submitting personal information through the Network, you authorize Sofie to share this personal information for the purposes identified herein and responding to user inquiries, processing transactions, and distributing materials through the Network.</p>

    <ul><b>Third Party Privacy Policies</b></ul>

    <p>Through the Network, you may be able to link to technology, software and services owned and controlled by third parties (“<b>Third Party Features</b>”). You may be permitted or required to submit personal information to access Third Party Features. Such use of Third Party Features and submission of information through Third Party Features will be subject to such applicable third party’s terms of use, terms of service and privacy policy. You agree to look solely to the applicable third party and not to Sofie to enforce your rights in relation thereto. When you have clicked on a third party logo or URL accessible through the Network, which links you to any Third Party Features, our Terms of Use no longer applies and you must read the terms of use, terms of service and privacy policy of the third party to see how your personal information will be handled on their website.</p>

    <ul><b>How We Use Your Personal Information</b></ul>

    <p>The personal information you provide to us will allow us to communicate with you and provide you with access to the Network. We may also use your email address in responding to your inquiries and processing your orders and requests made through the Network. We keep track of your interactions with us including, but not limited, to your activity within the Network. Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, or unless we have your consent, we will not share your personal information with any person or entity other than those affiliated with us, entities acting on our behalf, and relevant third parties such as those needed to collect and maintain our information collection servers and perform technology and related services.</p>

    <p>We may use your personal information with non-personal information that we have collected in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Network. We may make your personal information non-personally identifiable by either combining it with information about other users (aggregating your personal information with information about other users), or by removing characteristics (such as your name or email address) that make the information personally identifiable. This process is known as de-personalizing your information. You grant us a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and fully transferable right and license to use your personal information in connection with the creation and development of analytical and statistical analysis tools relating to the use of the customer data we collect in providing the Network (the “<b>Analytical Data</b>”). We are expressly authorized to make any commercial use of the Analytical Data including, without limitation, sharing the Analytical Data with third parties, provided that we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer from us any part of the Analytical Data that personally identifies any users of the Network.</p>

    <ul><b>Do Not Track</b></ul>

    <p>In compliance with California legislation, AB370, effective January 1, 2014, Sofie’s practices in responding to “do not track” signals and collecting user information over time and across a network of websites when you visit the Site are as follows: We do not respond requests of “do not track” signals sent by your browser when you visit the Network.  Sofie does not collect user information about your online activities over time and across different websites, or authorize third parties to do so.</p>

    <ul><b>Google Analytics</b></ul>

    <p>Sofie uses Google Analytics to help us learn about who visits the Network and what pages are viewed.</p>

    <ul><b>Cookies</b></ul>

    <p>“Cookies” are small bits of electronic information that a website sends to a visitor’s browser and are stored on the visitor’s hard drive. Like many websites, we employ cookies in certain areas of the Network to allow us to provide information to make your online experience more convenient. For example, when you return to the Network after logging in, cookies provide information to the Network so that the Network will remember who you are on subsequent visits, speeding up or enhancing your experience of the Network. Cookies may also be used to keep track of your login name and password. While we may use cookies to track your visit to the Site, this information does not identify you personally and you remain anonymous, even if you have previously submitted personal information to us through the Network or otherwise. You may still access the Network if you set your browser not to accept cookies.</p>

    <p>Third parties whose websites are accessible through links on the Site may also use their own cookies when you link to their site or service. Sofie does not control these third parties’ use of cookies and cannot guarantee that they will uphold the same privacy standards as we do. Sofie expressly disclaims any and all liability related to the collection, use or disclosure of information by third parties. You should review the privacy policies of any third party sites that you visit through a link from the Network to understand how these third parties use cookies and the information they collect through cookies. Most cookies are “session cookies” which means that they are automatically deleted at the end of each session. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you a chance to decide whether or not to accept it.</p>

    <ul><b>Log Information</b></ul>

    <p>Our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit the Network. This information includes your Internet Protocol address, your browser type and version, the search engine you used to find the Network, if any, areas of the Network you use and from where, and when and how long you use them. We use this information to monitor and analyze how users use the Network, to provide customer service and to maintain and improve the Network. This information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Network.</p>

    <ul><b>Children’s Privacy</b></ul>

    <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13, or allow them to create an account for the Network. We take children’s privacy seriously and encourage parents to play an active role in their children’s online experience at all times.</p>

    <ul><u><b>Will we share your personal information with third parties?</b></u></ul>

    <ul><b>Sharing Your Information</b></ul>

    <p>We use your personal information to provide you access to the Network, deliver products and services you request, complete transactions, and handle your support questions or issues. The personal information uploaded by you through the Network will be shared only with authorized persons to whom you specifically grant access. Also, we may use your depersonalized personal information to provide analyses of our users in the aggregate (including Analytical Data subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy) to prospective partners and other third parties. We will also share the personal information we collect from you under the following circumstances, and you expressly authorize us to share your information as follows:</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Asset transfers.</i> If we become involved in a merger, acquisition or other transaction involving the sale of some or all of Sofie’s assets, user information, including personal information collected from you through your use of the Network, could be included in the transferred assets. Should such an event occur, we will use reasonable means to notify you through email and/or a notice provided through the Network.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Service Providers.</i> We may share your personal information with service providers (including our affiliates that provide services on our behalf) that we engage for the purpose of processing information on our and your behalf, such as our marketing agency. Additionally, we may partner with other companies to process, analyze, and/or store data including, but not limited to, Analytical Data. While providing services for us, these companies may access your personal information. To the extent applicable, we require these entities to comply with this Privacy Policy and appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <ul><b>Additional Information You Should Know About Third Parties</b></ul>

    <p>The Network may contain direct links to websites operated by our partners and other entities. These third party websites may collect information about you when you visit them or otherwise communicate with them. This Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of third party websites accessible through the Network. Although we encourage such third parties to adopt and follow their own privacy policies, we are not responsible for their collection and use of your personal information. You should refer to the privacy policies and statements of other websites or contact the respective webmasters of those websites to obtain information regarding their information collection, use and disclosure policies. </p>

    <ul><b><u>What choices do you have about the collection and use of your personal information?</u></b></ul>

    <ul><b>Control of Your Information</b></ul>

    <p>You may update or delete your personal information or modify your account preferences for the Network by accessing the account interface provided through the Network or by sending an email to software@sofiebio.com. Please note that if you disable your account, we will keep your contact information on file, and may retain other account information for a reasonable period of time afterward for the purpose of internal account management and fraud prevention activities.</p>

    <ul><b>Opting Out of Receiving Communications from Us</b></ul>

    <p>If you no longer want to receive our emails or other announcements, you may unsubscribe by writing to us at software@sofiebio.com. Please note that you cannot unsubscribe from certain correspondence from us.</p>

    <ul><b>Mediation</b></ul>

    <p>You agree that, in the event any dispute or claim arises out of or relating to this Privacy Policy, you and Sofie will attempt in good faith to negotiate a written resolution of the matter directly between the parties. You agree that if the matter remains unresolved for forty-five (45) days after notification (via certified mail or personal delivery) that a dispute exists, all parties shall join in mediation services in Los Angeles, California with a mutually agreed mediator in an attempt to resolve the dispute. Should you file any arbitration claims, or any administrative or legal actions without first having attempted to resolve the matter by mediation, then you agree that you will not be entitled to recover attorneys’ fees, even if you would otherwise be entitled to them.</p>

    <ul><u><b>What security measures do we take to safeguard your personal information?</b></u></ul>

    <p>The personal information that you provide to us is stored on servers, which are located in secured facilities with restricted access, and protected by protocols and procedures designed to ensure the security of such information. In addition, we restrict access to personal information to Sofie employees, independent contractors and agents who need to know this information in order to develop, operate and maintain the Network. However, no server, computer or communications network or system, or data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect user information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or through the use of the Network and you acknowledge and agree that you provide such information and engage in such transmissions at your own risk. Once we receive a transmission from you, we will endeavor to maintain its security on our systems.</p>

    <p>In the event that personal information you provide to us is compromised as a result of a breach of security, when appropriate we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation, notify you and take the necessary steps to comply with any applicable laws and regulations.</p>
