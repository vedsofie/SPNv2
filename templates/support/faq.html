                                            The transfer position requires that the reactor vial is sealed against the bottom of the cassette and that the transfer dip tube is sealed tightly by the white gasket underneath the cassette. If the cassette gasket is old and worn, this seal may not be complete and will result in a pressure leak, causing liquid to transfer slowly if at all. Check all external cassette tubing for kinks or obstructions which may cause a clog. Finally, if you are transferring through a cartridge or where there may be a significant amount of fluidic resistance (e.g. to an HPLC sample loop), you may need to increase the delivery gas pressure either through the unit operation programming or by using the “Override” function and manually increasing the pressure.

                                            Unfortunately, the image quality from the camera will deteriorate when activity is present in the reactor vial due to the CCD array on the camera. Reactor lighting is typically pre-set by a SOFIE Engineer during the installation and should be optimal. However, other lights within/outside the hot cell may cause the video quality to change. Turning external lights off will most likely improve the image quality and lighting.

                                            During an evaporation step, the vacuum pump should achieve around -300 mmHg of vacuum if a pressure of ~5 psi is used. If the vacuum level is significantly worse than this (e.g. -100 mmHg), the vacuum system integrity may be compromised. Verify that the fittings to/from the cold trap are tight. This issue can also occur if cassette gaskets are re-used and deform slightly around the tubing.
                                            If the vacuum is very high (e.g. -450 mmHg), verify that there is no clog in the cold trap. If liquid nitrogen is used in the dewar or water is evaporated, a frozen clog may prevent the vacuum system from pulling on the reactor vial. Please see the ELIXYS Support Video “Common Issues” for how to properly fill up the dewar and install the cold trap.

                                            A motor with a magnetic head below the reactor vial will turn on during operations where the stir function is enabled. This head causes the stir bar within the reactor vial to spin as it moves. It is possible that the stir bar may get stuck or encounter significant friction against the reactor vial walls due to chemical build-up. Verify that there is a mixer disk below the reactor vial as well. Without a mixer disk, the reactor vial may slip and bump against the magnetic head, preventing it from spinning. See the ELIXYS Support Video “Common Issues” for more information about the mixer disk.

                                            The ELIXYS system uses passive cooling on the coolant used to cool the reactors. This means that it cannot be cooled below room temperature. Always ensure that the “Cool to temperature” is programmed to be above room temperature. The longer the system is left powered on and coolant is cycled through the instrument (e.g. during an evaporate operation), the “warmer” the coolant reservoir is and therefore the longer it will take to cool the system. Keeping your Control Box in a well-ventilated area will also help keep the coolant reservoir cool.

Always use new reagent vial septa to ensure that the septa are pristine before use and will not break up after many uses. Try to add the reagent to the other “Add” fluid path and see if this problem persists. Order new cassettes if the needles have been clogged due to frequent use.

Carefully pull the vial off of the Add position and verify that the needles are not bent. Verify that the needles did not puncture the metal crimp top either. We have seen this issue occur if the reagent vial crimping tool is not properly set during use; this will “squeeze” more of the septa material up and out of the crimp top, increasing the friction force on the needle. Please contact the ELIXYS Support Team for further information on how to correctly adjust the crimping tool.

Verify that all four cassette wing knobs are locked in and the cassette has not been “pushed up” by the reactor as it presses into the cassette. See the ELIXYS Support Video “Common Errors: Failed to Lift Reactor” for how to prevent this. Verify that the reagent robot homes properly all the way to the back right of the FLEX/CHEM and is not obstructed during its homing procedure. If the robot is obstructed, it may result in a position offset and prevent reagents from being picked up. See the ELIXYS Support Videos “Common Issues” and “Common Errors: Failed to Lower Gripper or Gas Transfer” for more details.

                                            Verify that all tubing connections are correct. The Transfer unit operation has three modes. The “Out” mode should be used when the transfer dip tube is connected directly to a collection vial, another cassette’s external input line, or an HPLC injection valve input line. The “Trap” mode should be used when the transfer dip tube is connected to the C2-O line on the cassette, possibly with a cartridge between. Liquid here is routed out of the cassette through the “W2” waste line. Finally, in the “Elute” mode, the cassette routes fluid to the “O” output line; typically this uses the same physical configuration as the “Trap” mode. <br>
                                            Before installing cassettes into the FLEX/CHEM, verify that the FLEX/CHEM is initialized and the cassette stopcock valves are rotated into the correct position. See the ELIXYS Support Video “Common Issues” for proper cassette configuration.

                                            The brightness observed in the reactor vial is a combination of the presence (or absence) of ambient light plus light provided by an LED on a small circuit board mounted on the side of the reactor. The brightness on the camera feed can also be adjusted in the software by navigating to the System -> Video tab and adjusting the contrast/brightness. Often times, tweaking the brightness in the software will allow you to see the liquid level within the reactor vial during all unit operations. <br><br>
                                            If you would like to adjust the brightness of the LED which provides light into the reactor vial, please see the linked PDF below. The LED is controlled by a small potentiometer which can be easily adjusted to control the output of light. You should make sure that you can see the liquid level at both “unit operation extremes” within the instrument: at the “darkest” position (Evaporate) and the “brightest” position (Transfer). As the reactor moves further back, the ambient light decreases and the camera feed will naturally darken. While increasing the LED’s brightness will help you see the liquid level at the evaporate position, it may be too bright to see the liquid level during the Transfer operation. You will need to adjust, test, and re-adjust as necessary.
                                            <br><br>
                                            One item to note: the light inside the hot cell/mini cell can greatly affect the camera feed shown on the software. If you have recently installed or replaced lighting within your cell, you may need to re-adjust your brightness settings. This is especially apparent on the Transfer operation where the reactor is all the way at the front of the instrument. We recommend always keeping the same lighting in your hot cell so you don’t have to keep adjusting the reactor’s LED brightness level.

                                            The liquid sensor can be calibrated from the System -> Fluid tab. Press “Calibrate” and follow the on-screen prompts. The video link below demonstrates how to do this. <br><br>
                                            Two things to note. First, you should always make sure that the injection valve input tubing is properly clipped into the sensor. If you press the tubing firmly into the sensor, you should hear a small “snap” sound; this indicates that the tubing is properly clipped in. Second, if your sample is very dark/turbid, the liquid sensor may have difficulty detecting it. The sensor is designed for clear liquids by measuring the absorption of light through the tubing but the sample may prevent it from operating as designed. Contact SOFIE if you believe that your sensor may have problems detecting your sample. <br><br>

                                            The evaporation rate of liquid inside the reactor vial is dependent on a few factors that can be controlled by the FLEX/CHEM: temperature, stirring, vacuum level, and pressure. Assuming that the synthesis sequence has not changed, there are other factors which may influence the evaporation rate. The flow rate of the gas into the reactor vial can influence the evaporation speed. Obstructions in the inert gas flow path (e.g. crusted residue on the tubing into the cassette) can reduce the flow rate and evaporation rate. Changing inert gas sources (e.g. Nitrogen to Helium) can also strongly affect the evaporation rate as gasses have different flow rates at the same pressure. Finally, make sure that your cold trap is properly emptied and cleaned between synthesis runs. Frozen liquid can build up within the stem of the cold trap and block gasses from being pulled into the vacuum pump; this will reduce your evaporation rate or potentially stop liquids from being evaporated entirely.

                                            Liquid on the underside of the cassette is a distinct sign of leaking stopcock valves within the cassette. Stopcocks are rated to 40 psi but overuse with harsh chemicals can reduce their integrity and cause them to leak at lower pressures. We strongly recommend replacing a cassette which shows signs of leaking with a new cassette. If leaking continues, you can risk damaging the instrument: seizing up a stopcock actuator, causing an electrical short if liquid drips onto the reactor, or even jamming a reactor’s linear actuator. All of these would lead to instrument downtime and require an on-site visit to remedy.

                                            The gripper has two rubber-coated fingers which grab the sides of reagent vials to move them around on the cassette. These fingers grip the reagent vial tightly but if there is too much resistance, the reagent vial may slip out of the fingers. The main cause of resistance is the needles that pierce the reagent vial septum. If there is too much friction between the needles and septum, the gripper may raise up but the reagent vial will stay “stuck” in the Add/Elute cassette positions. One common way that this can occur is if the crimping tool is no longer correctly crimping the reagent vial septa and metal top to the glass vial. See the linked PDF below for more information about this issue and instructions for how to adjust the crimping tool. Finally, make sure you use the correct septa for your reagent vials! The FLEX/CHEM cassettes are designed for specific components; using alternate parts may cause problems. Reagent vial components can be purchased in consumable or reagent kits through the consumables ordering section of SPN.

                                            A white or blue screen on the camera feed usually indicates one of two things. First, the power/video cord that plugs into the back of the camera may have become loose and fallen out of the connector. Take a picture behind the reactor to see if the cord has become loose; the cord connects into the bottom left of the camera as you stand in the front of the FLEX/CHEM. If the cord has become loose, press it in and then restart the FLEX/CHEM to see if that fixed the problem. <br><br>
                                            Second, the camera could have had liquid leak onto it and shorted the internal circuit board. This can occur in a variety of ways, but requires an on-site visit from SOFIE to remedy as the camera is “dead”. If you believe your camera may have “died”, please contact SOFIE for further information.

                                            Below each reactor vial, a mixer motor with a magnetic head spins to create a changing magnetic field which causes a stir bar within the reactor vial to spin. Both the mixer motor and the stir bar affect stirring within the reactor vial. Make sure that the mixer disk is present within the reactor before placing your reactor vial into the reactor. This eliminates the possibility of the reactor vial slipping and pressing onto the mixer motor’s magnetic head which prevents it from rotating. When the reactor is “up” and engaged with the cassette, you can see the mixer motor below the reactor vial spinning when it is turned on; verify that you can see the mixer spinning before contacting SOFIE for assistance. <br> <br>

Finally, make sure you use the correct stir bars. Stir bars which are too large or small may not stir correctly. The FLEX/CHEM was designed for the stir bars provided during the installation. If new stir bars should be ordered, contact SOFIE for more information.

                                            The most common cause of this problem is a frozen cold trap stem. If liquid freezes and clogs the cold trap stem, the vacuum pump can pull a strong (<-400 mmHg) vacuum on the cold trap but will not pull any vapor out of the reactor vial. To avoid this issue, first always empty and clean your cold trap between syntheses. Second, always use a dry ice/methanol slurry in your cold trap. Liquid nitrogen can freeze certain gasses that could clog the cold trap stem and can potentially crack and compromise the white compression fittings on the top of the cold trap. Finally, avoid evaporating large amounts of water if possible, as water freezes very easily within the cold trap and can clog the stem.

                                            There are two primary causes of slow transferring to the injection valve. First, a clog could have built up somewhere within the injection valve fluid paths. This can occur if the injection valve is not cleaned regularly and particulates/residue are allowed to build up. The injection valve head can be cleaned to remove these clogs; see the linked PDF below. <br> <br>

                                            The FLEX/CHEM uses pressurized inert gas to force liquid out of the reactor vial and through tubing into the injection valve. If the cassette gasket was replaced incorrectly, adhesive residue could have clogged the small gas delivery needle in the Transfer position. This will prevent or significantly reduce how much inert gas can drive the liquid flow, resulting in very slow liquid transfer rates. This can be avoided when cassette gaskets are replaced; see the video below for a demonstration on how to replace cassette gaskets correctly.

                                            The PURE/FORM module requires the HPLC pump to be powered on in order to communicate properly with the ELIXYS software. Unfortunately, the pump will not automatically turn on when the power strip is turned on. The power button on the front of the pump must be pressed. This turns the button blue and will allow communication with the software.
                                            If the “PF system is not responding” message appears, this indicates that the software cannot connect to the PURE/FORM. Check that power is being supplied; the fans on the back of the PURE/FORM should be on. Also, check that the ethernet cable from the PURE/FORM into the airport router is plugged in securely and has not become disconnected. If the problem persists, contact ELIXYS Support.

                                            Air bubbles are common in HPLC systems and can be tricky to eliminate. First, ensure that the mobile phases used are degassed properly, either through sonication, bubbling inert gas, or using a dedicated degasser. Next, purge the HPLC pump head as described in the PURE/FORM User Manual. When purged for 5-10 minutes, there should be no air bubbles in the mobile phase input line into the pump or in the pump head itself.
                                            Next, use the Standalone screen to run HPLC pump to waste without a column present (typically the bypass tubing is connected to column position #4). Visually check that the waste line has no air bubbles inside of it. It may take some time for the HPLC system to be flushed of air bubbles, e.g. 30 minutes or more. If any column position was recently changed, verify that the fittings are tight and there is no leaking present.

                                            The liquid sensors are calibrated before the installation has completed and are verified to be correctly identifying the head and tail of the sample as it passes through the sensor. However, there are a few common scenarios which would prevent the sensor from functioning correctly.
                                            The most common scenario is that when the transfer from the ELIXYS to the PURE/FORM starts, the tubing between the cassette and the PURE/FORM already has liquid inside of it. This can happen if the tubing is not properly dried out after a transfer operation has been done. The residual liquid in the tubing will cause the liquid sensor to detect a false head and tail and switch the injection valve into the inject position prematurely. To dry out the tubing first connect the cassette output (either the “O” output line or the dip tube itself) to the PURE/FORM input tubing. Then run a Transfer sequence with a dry, empty reactor vial. Set the pressure for transfer to a high value, 10 or 15 psi. Let the sequence run for at least 5 minutes; this will cause all liquid inside of the tubing to be forced out/dried out.
                                            The second common scenario is that the tubing has been moved or disturbed enough so that it is not seated properly inside the liquid sensor body. For example, this can happen if the user removes a cassette from the ELIXYS without first disconnecting the input line. To seat the tubing inside the sensor, take the tubing out and grasp the tubing with the thumb and forefinger of both hands. Carefully push both ends down into the sensor. To double check, use a small flat-head screwdriver to gently press the tubing down. The tubing will “click” when it is in the correct position.
                                            Lastly, ensure that the correct input tubing is connected to the correct liquid sensor. It is possible that these tubes could be switched. After this, verify that the Transfer operation destination sample loop matches the input tubing number used.

If the dilution reservoir overfills, the system will detect the overflow and cut off the HPLC pump. Two things can be done to recover from this situation. The user can “continue” the Purification unit operation to proceed to the Formulation unit operation if that is next. Alternatively, the user can create a sequence with a Formulation unit operation. When the Trap step starts, the product will be pushed out of the PURE/FORM through the SPE cartridge. Finally, the user could enter the Standalone screen and navigate to the Formulation sub-system and then set a pressure in the Trap step.

To keep the sample loops full of mobile phase, navigate to the Standalone screen. Turn the HPLC pump on and let it pump 10 ml total. Then change the injection valve position (e.g. from #2 to #1) and wait for another 10 ml of mobile phase to flow through. This fills both loops entirely with mobile phase. However, there will usually be air in front of the sample due to the dead volume in the tubing connecting the cassette.

                                            This is often because there is a leak in the high pressure portion of the Purification sub-system. This is all systems downstream of the HPLC pump and upstream of the HPLC column: tubing out of the HPLC pump, tubing into injection valve, fittings on the injection valve, tubing into the column selector, fittings on the column selector, and fittings into the HPLC column (and/or guard column). Identifying leaks early is critical! They are almost always easily observed by a sharp decrease of HPLC pump pressure. Always keep an eye on the pressure, note when it seems out of the expected range, and be ready to identify leaks quickly.

                                              9) PURE/FORM: Why does the HPLC pump pressure drops dramatically when the sample is injected?

                                            When the PURE/FORM switches the injection valve from the “Load” to the “Inject” position, the HPLC pump becomes connected to the sample loop. In most cases, the liquid sample volume transferred from the FLEX/CHEM reactor vial to the PURE/FORM sample loop is less than the 5 ml capacity of the sample loop. This results in air being trapped within the sample loop. Once the HPLC pump is connected to a sample loop which contains air, the liquid it pumps out will first compress the air. This is very “easy” for the pump to do, and therefore the pressure will drop; this is completely normal. As the air is compressed more and more, the pressure required to move liquid increases. Eventually the air will enter the column and the pressure will recover. Please see the linked PDF below for a detailed explanation on how this process occurs. <br><br>

                                            The formulation fluid path contains various valves and tubing to implement the designed functionality. The output of the syringe pump used to dispense liquids for the formulation operation is connected to this fluid path. Due to the tubing/valves within the fluid path, there is a “dead volume” of approximately 950 μl between the output of the syringe pump and the end of the “final product” output line. If the formulation fluid path is not completely full of liquid, this will result in a reduction of the dispensed amount. The type of liquid used in your operations will also affect the accuracy of the syringe pump. Liquids with different viscosities (e.g. DMSO) will affect how accurate the syringe pump will aspirate and dispense the liquid. For a much greater in-depth look into how to achieve accurate dispensed volumes, please see the first section (syringe pump dispensing accuracy) of the PURE/FORM common issues video linked below. <br><br>
